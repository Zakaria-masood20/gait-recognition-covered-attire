# Trained Models

This directory contains trained machine learning models for gait recognition.

## Available Models

### Traditional ML Models (included in repo)
- `decision_tree_model.pkl` - Decision Tree classifier
- `random_forest_model.pkl` - Random Forest classifier  
- `svm_model.pkl` - Support Vector Machine classifier
- `knn_model.pkl` - K-Nearest Neighbors classifier

### Deep Learning Models (too large for GitHub)
Due to file size limitations, the following LSTM models are not included in the repository:
- `lstm_00_ES.h5` (52MB) - LSTM model trained on 0Â° angle data with Early Stopping

These large models can be:
1. Stored separately on Google Drive or cloud storage
2. Tracked using Git LFS (Large File Storage)
3. Generated by running the training notebooks

## Model Performance Visualizations
The `.png` files contain performance metrics and confusion matrices for each model:
- Training/validation curves
- Confusion matrices
- Classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)

## Usage
To load the models in Python:

```python
import pickle
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load traditional ML models
with open('decision_tree_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    dt_model = pickle.load(f)

# Load LSTM models (if available locally)
lstm_model = load_model('lstm_00_ES.h5')
```
